        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>We are undergoing the difficult time right now in 2020 since the outburst of the COVID-19. The global
            pandemic is causing so many distress in us.
            I have been keeping myself busy with movies, books, and cooking while conducting social distancing
            to
            prevent the spread of the virus for over two weeks now (today's date is March 28th, 2020).
            Recently, I am revisiting the Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This is book is his journals for himself to go
            through hard times.
            I find some of the quotes very relevent especially for the COVID-19 situation.
            I feel the urge to create something so that people can talk about their feelings. </p>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The final project by <a target="_blank" href="https://letssharefinalproject.herokuapp.com/">Ashwita
                Palekar</a>, my dearest friend. </p>

        <h2>Thought Process</h2>

        <h3>Interaction Flow</h3>

        <ul class="flow">
            <li>
                Load the website.
            </li>
            <li>Read the intro.
            </li>
            <li>
                Speak out your thoughts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigate to explore more features.
            </li>
            <li>
                Save the visuals.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Design Elements</h3>
        <p>
            The most important part in terms of design is the pastel color palette. For the shapes, I used
            <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/2UIbKJL">this palette</a>, while for the background, I used
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.schemecolor.com/pastel-color-tones.php">this palette</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Libraries</h3>
        <p>
            This project is built with <a target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a target="_blank"
                href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">p5.speech.js</a> along with CSS, html and Javascript.

            I used p5 speech library to recognize the spoken words and convert them into texts.
            I split the speech content into words and found the end letter to each word to assign the color of the
            shapes.
        </p>

        <h3>Color</h3>
        <p>
            The background color is changed accordingly to the amount of letters in one sentence.
            I originally only had circles to be generated accordingly to the speech. I wanted to add layers to it.
            Thus, I created lines, triangles, and arcs.
        </p>
        <h3>Fonts</h3>
        <p>
            I also implement four types of fonts for the same reason:
            <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald">Oswald</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao">Liu Jian Mao Cao</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spicy+Rice">Spicy Rice</a>, and
            <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cairo">Cairo</a>.

            For the branding, I adapted the look of
            <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Uo6vjF">a typical sound spectrogram</a>
            and simplified it into the logo we see here.
            The style for the Audio Diary is minimalistic yet welcoming. In order to make it more welcoming,
            I used the font
            <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville"></a>Libre Baskerville</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            In order to make the interaction smooth, I added some features such as footer and header inside the
            canvas to prompt the users to explore more.</p>

        <h2>Next Step</h2>
        <p>I am making other websites in the meantime to respond to hard times like the current pandemic of COVID-19.
            Hopefully,
            I will build a collection of these interactive websites together to alleviate the stress.
