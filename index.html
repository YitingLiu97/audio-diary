    <p>
      Welcome to the Audio Diary where you get to share your thoughts during hard times.
      Inspired by my favorite quote by Marcus Aurelius: "All is as thinking makes it so."
      It celebrates anonymity and does not save your thoughts.</p>

     
     <p> Play with the arrow keys and move your mouse around. You may discover something new.
      You can, however, save the visuals to your devices.</p>
      
      <p>I hope through this, you can start a conversation with yourself and look within.
      What is something that we can adjust ourselves to?
      What are some of your thoughts in their pure form?
       Maybe, this could be your personal sanctuary while exercising social distancing.
